"""Tests for `evomas.config.history` — the GitPython-backed version log
that powers the topology page's History panel.

Each test runs against a temporary `LOADED_DIR` so the user's real
loaded-configs history isn't touched. `monkeypatch.setattr` swaps the
module-level path constant before each call so `_ensure_repo()` initses
inside the tmp dir."""
