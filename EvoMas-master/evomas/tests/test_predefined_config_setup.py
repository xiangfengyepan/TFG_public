"""Setup smoke test for every predefined config.

For each file in `evomas/config/predefined/*.json`, verify the full
inference pipeline starts cleanly:

  1. `load_config` parses the JSON.
  2. `_build_agents` resolves every `class` field against the
     `AGENT_REGISTRY` and instantiates each agent block.
  3. `build_state_class` builds a TypedDict that covers every node.
  4. `build_graph` compiles a LangGraph from the wiring rules.
  5. `clone_workspace` is invoked (mocked → returns a local tmp git
     repo, so no SWE-bench-scale network clone happens during tests).
  6. `graph.invoke(initial_state)` runs at least the entry node.

LLM calls are stubbed at `LLMToolAgent._run_llm_loop` so the test
doesn't need Ollama running — every agent immediately returns a
minimal delta and the graph walks every node deterministically.

The test only checks that the setup *kicks off* without raising; it
does NOT assert anything about the final patch or per-agent
behaviour. That's the contract the user asked for: "no need to wait
until it finishes, but does the git clone, etc and starts running
the entry agent". A config that compiles + clones + dispatches the
entry node without an exception is considered structurally healthy.
