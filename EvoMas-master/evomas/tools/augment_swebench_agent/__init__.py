"""augment_swebench_agent tool re-implementations.

Two augment-specific tools (`CompleteTool`, `SequentialThinkingTool`)
plus a re-export of the canonical OpenHands `StrReplaceEditorTool` —
augment's upstream `str_replace_tool` is the same exact-match editor;
re-exporting avoids a duplicate MCP registration.
